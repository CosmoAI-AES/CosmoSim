Docker images have been created for different purposes.

# local (Summer 2025)

This docker image was created to test the build on Ubuntu 24.04, 
to prepare for running it in a github runner.

It is retained as a build example FIW.

In the end, it differs little from the regular build.sh script
in the root of the repo.

# manylinux (August 2025) 

This is created to test the build in the same environment
as cibuildwheel.

# sim (old) 

This is one of many attempts to make CosmoSim available on 
different platforms.  It has not been tested for years.
