These are conan profiles, used for testing and debugging of the
build environments.  

+ They are no longer used in the scripts.  The default profile
  works fine on my own boxen, and other boxes may need other profiles.
+ They are no longer used for linux or macos targets in the github 
  workflows.
+ The windows workflow does not currently work, and may require these
  profiles.
