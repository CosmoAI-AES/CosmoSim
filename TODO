1.  Test program
    - print \nabla\psi
    - Print mass map and psi map
2.  Fix getCentre()
3.  Make SIS without rotation
2.  P/Ben David: sign \psi
3.  Comparison of Roulette PM and exact PM
4.  Distinguish between True xi and Rotated xi (on the x-axis)
5.  Validate distort
    - Note Source image is drawn at the origin
    - check rotations - origin is fixed?
6.  Document flow of image transformations
7.  Clarify local co-ordinate system
    - origin in the centre of the image
    - horizontal first axis, vertical second axis
