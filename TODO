1.  Multiple viewpoints
    - debug
    - compose images
1.  Secondary Image
    - setXi for RoulettePM 
    - test script
1.  Test GUI
    - then make new baseline
3.  Test and clean up mass map and psi map
    - export raw psi/kappa and make 3D plots
    - compile a demo
    - print \nabla\psi
4.  Alternative reference point for roulette
    -  Clean up the secondary image
        - Separate lens parameters and position - separate Simulator class and lens model?
        - Separate actual position (eta) and local source plane origin
            - eta is fixed; origin can change
            - recalculate nu (apparentAbs) and thus xi when the origin is changed
            - setter for xi - recalculate local source origin (eta') 
5.  Prepare release
    - Which issues should be fixed?
    - CHANGELOG
6.  Documentation in paper
    - Document flow of image transformations
7.  Validate distort
    - Note Source image is drawn at the origin
    - check rotations - origin is fixed?
8.  Clarify local co-ordinate system
    - origin in the centre of the image
    - horizontal first axis, vertical second axis
    - validate code
9.  High resolution sampling
