1.  Test and clean up mass map and psi map
    - export raw psi/kappa and make 3D plots
    - compile a demo
    - print \nabla\psi
2.  Clean up test scripts
    - Rotation comparison
    - Comparison of Roulette PM and exact PM
    - High resolution sampling
    - Review debug.csv
3.  Alternative reference point for roulette
4.  Documentation in paper
    - Document flow of image transformations
4.  P/Ben David: sign \psi
5.  Distinguish between True xi and Rotated xi (on the x-axis)
6.  Validate distort
    - Note Source image is drawn at the origin
    - check rotations - origin is fixed?
7.  Clarify local co-ordinate system
    - origin in the centre of the image
    - horizontal first axis, vertical second axis
    - validate code
8.  Clean up the secondary image
